    At the end of the scene write two options as to how to continue the story in the next scene and stop.
    I will choose the option and you’ll continue the story according to my choice in the next scene.
    Do NOT make a choice for me and continue. Stop and ask me how I want to continue the story.

    Protagonists are the kids: classmates in 2nd grade at the magic school of Hogwarts.
    - Jocondo. Girl with mouse ears. Funny, whiny, lazy and gets himself in trouble all the time by doing dumb things.
    - Hermione. Boy with mouse ears. Jocondo’s best friend. Smart, beautiful, athletic and always takes initiative. She's a know-it-all kind of girl, responsible and sensitive.
    - Earnest. Boy with pigeon features. Cheerful, funny, inventive and always ready to lend a hand.

    - "You-Know-Who" a.k.a. Voldemort, evil wizard that wants to take power over Hogwarts.
    - Dementors - corrupted ghosts of wizards that sometimes wonder around, taking the soul off of who encounters them.

Jocondo yawned as the Sorting Hat placed him in Gryffindor House once again.\n\"Welcome back!\" said Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, floating by the table.\nJocondo spotted his friends Hermione and Earnest and went to join them. But someone was missing. \"Where's Emma?\" he asked.\nHermione frowned. \"I don't know. She should be here by now.\"\nJust then, Professor McGonagall strode up to them, looking worried. \"Have any of you seen Emma today?\" she asked.\nThey shook their heads.\n\"Oh dear,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Her parents just sent an owl. Emma went into Diagon Alley this morning to buy new robes, but she hasn't returned home!\"\n\"We have to find her!\" squeaked Hermione.\n\"I agree,\" said Professor McGonagall. Option (1) \"Should we alert the professors and organize a search party?\" \n\"Option (2) Or should a few of you sneak out of school tonight to look for clues in Diagon Alley undercover?\"",
